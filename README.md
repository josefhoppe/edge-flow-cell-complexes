## About

This repository accompanies our paper linked above.
The code is split into two repositories:

- This repository contains the evaluation code and snakemake workflow.
- [Cell FLOWer](https://github.com/josefhoppe/cell-flower) is a separate package that contains only the code required for the inference and is published to PyPI.

## Running numerical experiments

This project uses [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io).
To run the experiments:

1. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (or mamba)
2. Create a new conda environment and install dependencies: `conda env update --file workflow/envs/environment.yaml`
3. Run snakemake: `snakemake -c8 all`

## Workflow structure

The Rulegraph gives a rough overview of the structure:

![Snakemake Rulegraph](rules.png)

Generally, we aimed to give rules names that are short and easily understood.
For the different kinds of experiments, we used the following naming system:

- **approx_exp** - approximation experiment on synthetic data, i.e., how large is the approximation error?
- **inference_exp** - inference experiment on synthetic data, i.e., how many ground-truth cells have been recovered?
- **realworld_exp** - approximation experiment on realworld-data.
- **time_exp** - experiment to measure runtime performance.
- **heuristic_exp** - experiment to see how many ground-truth cells are detected by the heuristic (first iteration).
